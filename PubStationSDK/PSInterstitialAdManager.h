 @abstract   This class contains the PubStation Interstitial Ad Manager. It contains all the functions to retrieve and show ads.
           
 @discussion In the simplest case (default behaviour), fetching of ads is happening automatically; in particular, this means that
             in this case the only methods of this class you might use are @b isAdReady (for checking, if an ad is available for playing)
             and @b showVideoAd (to play the interstitial ad).
 
             In addition to that, you might want to use the @b loadDelegate and
             @b playDelegate objects to let you inform about ad loading and playing events.
